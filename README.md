# Basic Caesar Cipher
**Extremely easy to code, and even easier to crack.**
- Meant to be able to be sent through text, e-mail, files, and everything else.
- Can be coded on any language without using external libraries.
- Completely secure. Real E2E encryption. **No government spying.**
## How it works:
You probably think that for an encryption to be completely secure, the private key has to be random. **It doesn't.**
