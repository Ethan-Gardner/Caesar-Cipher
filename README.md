# Basic C++ Caesar Cipher
**History and Origin:**

The Caesar Cipher, used by Julius Caesar around 58 BC, is a substitution cipher that shifts letters in a message to make it unreadable if intercepted. To decrypt, the receiver reverses the shift. Arab mathematician Al-Kindi broke the Caesar Cipher using frequency analysis, which exploits patterns in letter frequencies[^1].
## How it works:
By shifting the values of letters by a certain amoumt, a basic encryption is created.
